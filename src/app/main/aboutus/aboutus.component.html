            <br>
            <p><strong>Program in Reading Advocacy Intended for Students' Enrichment</strong> in Reading Comprehension –is a Computer-Based Strategic Intervention Material (SIM) for Students under Frustration Level which helps to improve the reading level of learners from frustration to instructional and/or independent.
            <br><br>
            Learning to read is a particularly hard endeavor for students. There are things to consider such as phonemic awareness; phonics, spelling pattern, vocabulary, comprehension, etc., These things can make reading frustrating for Senior High school students. Thus, we recognize that our school is faced with variety of challenges when it comes to teaching reading. To address the reading problems and to give assistance to learners with reading difficulties, the School Reading Coordinator devised a reading program which aims to assess the learners’ reading ability. Helping students with reading problems is an on-going process. Helping students who are struggling with reading begins with understanding the difficulties that are hindering them.  Through various reading materials, instructional devices, reading strategies, and techniques, we can help improve the deteriorating reading proficiency of our learners nowadays. This assessment led to the presentation of the School Reading Program.
